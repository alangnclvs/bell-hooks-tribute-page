            "Sometimes people try to destroy you, precisely because they
            recognize your power â€“ not because they don't see it, but because
            they see it and they don't want it to exist." - Bell Hooks

            Bell Hooks, born Gloria Jean Watkins, was a pioneering American
            author, feminist, and social activist. Her journey began in
            Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in a racially segregated society, igniting

            Her groundbreaking books, such as "Ain't I a Woman?", "Feminist
            Theory: From Margin to Center", and "The Will to Change: Men,
            Masculinity, and Love", challenged conventional perspectives and
            laid the foundation for modern feminist discourse. Hooks' insightful
            critique of patriarchy, racism, and sexism continues to resonate
            across diverse audiences.

        <section id="history">
          <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
          <p>
            Bell Hooks, born on September 25, 1952, navigated the challenges of
            racial segregation in her formative years. Her resilience and
            curiosity led her to pursue higher education. Hooks earned a
            bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University and a master's
            degree in English from the University of Wisconsin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her experiences in academia shaped her commitment to intersectional
            feminism, a perspective that examines how different forms of
            oppression intersect. Hooks' academic journey laid the groundwork
            for her influential career as a scholar and social critic.
